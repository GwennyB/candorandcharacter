Write user stories for each possible role. User stories follow the format of: As a ___, I want ___ so that ___. Remember, user stories tell...
Who needs a feature (and a brief descriptor of their role/relationship to the app)
What they want that feature to do
Why they want it
If you want a feature in the app, you MUST have at least one user story (preferably more, if multiple users want it) that requires it. No exceptions.

***SPLASH PAGE
As a user, I want a splash page that welcomes me to the website.
As a user, I want a, "make it pretty," (Scott's Voice) styled D&D themed splash page.
As a user, I want Candor and Character center on the page above the navigation bar.
As a user, I want navigation bar on splash page.
As a developer, I want to divide the main elements divided up in three sections.
As a user, I want to see the character sheet interface in the center section of the main.
As a user, I want previous sessions stored for display.
As a user, I want to a large create new character button.
As a developer, I want to show the users relevant art right left asides.

***CHARACTER SHEET PAGE
As a user, I want to use the wizards of the coast standard character sheet format.
As a user, I want to respond to a series of questions to determine my character.
As a developer, to divide the character sheet by three main sections.
As a developer, create a first main section that determines character race, name, etc.
As a developer create the second main section is character attributes.
As a developer, create the third section for battles states.
As a developer, we want to align user interaction with intended functional flow.
 


MVP
Now for the hard part. Take your user stories and prioritize.
What absolutely has to be part of your app for it to ship? (Another way to think of this is: if the app is missing a certain feature, can you still use it?) This is your MVP. In your user-stories.md file, move these user stories into an MVP section.



STRETCH GOALS
The remaining user stories are your stretch goals. In the user-stories.md file, move them into a "Stretch Goals" section. Then, list them in order from easiest to implement (at the top) to hardest to implement (at the bottom). If you get your MVP done and still have time, you'll tackle the stretch goals.
