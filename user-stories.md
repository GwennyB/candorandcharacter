MVP
Now for the hard part. Take your user stories and prioritize.
What absolutely has to be part of your app for it to ship? (Another way to think of this is: if the app is missing a certain feature, can you still use it?) This is your MVP. In your user-stories.md file, move these user stories into an MVP section.



STRETCH GOALS
The remaining user stories are your stretch goals. In the user-stories.md file, move them into a "Stretch Goals" section. Then, list them in order from easiest to implement (at the top) to hardest to implement (at the bottom). If you get your MVP done and still have time, you'll tackle the stretch goals.
