            <P>Hi, my name is Jason Few<br>
              I have always been interested in tech, but the thought of learning to program is very intimidating.  After working on social justice issues for many years and feeling proud of my contribution to society, I decided I wanted to spend the rest of my life making a difference in a new way.  Software is one of the most important developments in human history, and I am excited to get to be a part of its evolution.
              I am a productive, creative, punctual and team focused individual.  I have received awards from every employer I have workd for, I received a plaque of appreciation from the State of Washington and King County, I also received an award for the work I did developing reentry programming for individuals returning to our communities from prison.  I bring a lot of creativity, friendliness and results to my employers. 
              Because I have a proven and documented track record of bringing results in a professional and team focused manner, I can provide every performance evaluation from the past 15 years that demonstrate that I consistently go above and beyond for my employer.  I can guarantee a substantial return on your investment in me.  </P>
