        PURPOSE OF CANDOR & CHARACTER
      </h2>
      <p>Candor & Character offers an entertaining approach to creating a Dungeons & Dragons character using the Wizards Of The Coast character sheet. The twist, hence the word candor, is that the character's stats are derived from a series of quizzes that you answer in an honest and/or fun way. So, don’t take it too seriously. The point is to have fun and create a silly character that you wouldn't otherwise choose. So which character are you based on our questionnaire? Take the quiz and find out. If you've already taken the quiz, invite your friends to try and compare your results!</p>

          <p>Hi, my name is Jason Few. I have always been interested in tech, but the thought of learning to program is very intimidating.  After working on social justice issues for many years and feeling proud of my contribution to society, I decided I wanted to spend the rest of my life making a difference in a new way.  Software is one of the most important developments in human history, and I am excited to get to be a part of its evolution. I am a productive, creative, punctual and team focused individual.  I have received awards from every employer I have workd for, I received a plaque of appreciation from the State of Washington and King County, I also received an award for the work I did developing reentry programming for individuals returning to our communities from prison.  I bring a lot of creativity, friendliness and results to my employers. Because I have a proven and documented track record of bringing results in a professional and team focused manner, I can provide every performance evaluation from the past 15 years that demonstrate that I consistently go above and beyond for my employer.  I can guarantee a substantial return on your investment in me.</p>

          <p>I'm Gwen, and I'm so glad you've visited our webpage!  I haven't played D&D in over 20 years, but this project has inspired me to find my way back in.</p>
          <p>I am an aspiring ASP.NET and Python developer with extensive background in engineering and leadership. I am dedicated to maximizing customer and organizational value with high quality, efficient work product. By way of an engineering and product development career path winding through defense, aerospace, and heavy equipment, I've accumulated expertise in all aspects of product lifecycle management, customer-centric product strategy and business operations, and leading technical teams to success. Having designed, tested, and fielded physical products in the physical domain (ie - geometry, materials, thermal management, and tactile controls), I now endeavor to expand into the domain of software products, beginning with full-stack web development using ASP.NET, C#, Razor, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and Python.</p>
