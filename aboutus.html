        PURPOSE OF CANDOR & CHARACTER
      </h2>
      <p>The purpose of candor & character was to create a dungeon and dragons character using the wizards of the coast character sheet. The twist, hence the word candor, is to create a random character from a series of quizzes and us judging you in a honest and fun way. So, don’t take it too seriously. The point is to have fun and create a silly character that you wouldn't otherwise choose. So which character are you based on our questionnaire? Take the quiz and find out. If you've already taken the quiz, print it out and show your friends. Then tell them to create their own character by visiting our website.</p>

            <P>Hi, my name is Jason Few<br>
              I have always been interested in tech, but the thought of learning to program is very intimidating.  After working on social justice issues for many years and feeling proud of my contribution to society, I decided I wanted to spend the rest of my life making a difference in a new way.  Software is one of the most important developments in human history, and I am excited to get to be a part of its evolution.,
              I am a productive, creative, punctual and team focused individual.  I have received awards from every employer I have work for as well as a plaque of appreciation from the State of Washington and King County as well as an award for the work I did developing reentry programming for individuals returning to our communities from prison.  I bring a lot of creativity, friendliness and results to my employers. 
              Because I have a proven and documented track record of bringing results in a professional and team focused manner.  I can provide every performance evaluation from the past 15 years that demonstrate that I consistently go above and beyond for my employer.  I can guarantee a substantial return on your investment in me.  </P>
